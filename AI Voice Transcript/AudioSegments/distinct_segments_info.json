That's like, regardless of what actual type of request it is, this is just saying if it's corporate, it's corporate. If it's community, they have to pick a community where what we're talking about now is kind of like a different type of a bond request. Right? And so the existing ones in the system now all uses kind of this. These questions and they have to fill them in in order to complete it. But now we have a new one and so we have to figure out what is the same as these one these questions here and what are new questions that we need to ask just for this, this type.",
