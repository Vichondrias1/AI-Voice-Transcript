So then I have to go do a Smart Stream query and bring all those descriptions in so we have some real information in there. And then for the ones that come through mri, those. And the. For the HTM starts with H. That's a new MRI system. So everything came through MRI for that htn. Those are just easier with the invoice number, the description, vendor ID and vendor name. So I'm kind of going back and forth between Smart Stream, depending on the htn just so we have real information in the journal entry. Because I. Then I have to. Who knows what Paul's going to ask for in four years and we have to go back and look at that. So I want real information in there. So those in this one, column K is the Smart Stream description. Instead of CV balance that came through for the conversion, I'm using column K as the descriptions. I'm changing all of everything in column E. And those yellow lines there where it's 150 negative and then down on line 28 it's a 150 positive or 350 and 150. So those lines originate in the same account number and then they're being reclassed. So it looks like in column e it says March 2020. I reclassed those out because they were coded incorrectly. So I wouldn't want to include those lines. Or I. You. I currently don't.
